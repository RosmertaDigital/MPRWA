																	<b>Educate yourself against Fraud/Scams</b>
																	<p>
																		We encourage you to read the following and make yourself aware of the warning signs of the most common kinds of Internet and Email
																		frauds. There are two types of email scams - 'phishing' and 'spoofing'. In both the cases, the 'from address' is forged to make it appear as if it
																		came from a source that it actually did not come from.
																	</p>

																	<b>What is Phishing?</b>
																	<p>
																		Phishing is an attempt by fraudsters to 'fish' for your personal details. A phishing attempt is usually in the form of an e-mail, which encourages you to click a link that takes you to a fraudulent log-on page designed to capture your account/password/personal details. These emails
																		can also be used to lure the recipient into downloading harmful software. Please note that rosmertahsrp will never ask you to download
																		software in order to access your information. More information about Phishing scams and how you can protect yourself against them is
																		available here http://www.antiphishing.org/consumer_recs.html
																	</p>

																	<b>What is Spoofing?</b>
																	<p>
																		Spoof emails usually include a fraudulent offer of employment and/or an invitation to perform a monetary transaction. Such email scams are,
																		unfortunately, common across the world and could target anyone - including unsuspecting jobseekers. The sender's address is often
																		disguised and/or the sender may not have provided the entire contact information, such as, the correct physical address, phone numbers and
																		email id.
